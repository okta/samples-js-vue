  <div id="home">
    <h1 class="ui header">Custom Login Page with Sign In Widget</h1>
    <div v-if="!this.$parent.authenticated">
      <p>If youâ€˜re viewing this page then you have successfully started this Vue application.</p>
      <p>This example shows you how to use the
        <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-oidc-js/tree/master/packages/okta-vue">Okta Vue Library</a>
        and the
        <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-signin-widget">Okta Sign-In Widget</a>
        to add the
        <a href="https://developer.okta.com/authentication-guide/implementing-authentication/implicit">Implicit Flow</a>
        to your application.
        This combination is useful when you want to leverage the features of the Sign-In Widget, and the authentication helper components from the okta-vue module.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you have logged in you will be redirected through your authorization server (the issuer defined in config) to create a session for Single-Sign-On (SSO).
        After this you will be redirected back to the application with an ID token and access token. The tokens will be stored in local storage for future use.
      </p>
      <router-link
        id="login-button"
        class="ui primary button"
        role="button"
        to="/login"
      >
      Login
      </router-link>
    </div>

    <div v-if="this.$parent.authenticated">
      <p>Welcome back, {{claims.name}}!</p>
      <p>
        You have successfully authenticated against your Okta org, and have been redirected back to this application.  You now have an ID token and access token in local storage.
        Visit the <a href="/profile">My Profile</a> page to take a look inside the ID token.
      </p>
      <h3>Next Steps</h3>
      <p>
        Currently this application is a stand-alone front end application.
        At this point you can use the access token to authenticate yourself against resource servers that you control.
      </p>
      <p>
        This sample is designed to work with one of our resource server examples.
        To see access token authentication in action, please download one of these resource server examples:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li
          v-for="(example, index) in resourceServerExamples"
          :key="index"
        >
          <a :href="example.url">{{example.label}}</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Once you have downloaded and started the example resource server, you can visit the <a href="/messages">My Messages</a> page to see the authentication process in action.</p>
